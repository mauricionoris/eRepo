## Purpose

The primary purpose of eRepo is to provide a solution for LMS systems, particularly Moodle, that allows educators and course creators to deliver learning content in a more personalized and context-aware manner. Traditional LMS systems often provide static, one-size-fits-all content, which may not be the most effective way to facilitate learning. eRepo takes a different approach by leveraging semantic annotations to enable adaptive learning.

Semantic annotations allow for the meaningful tagging of learning content with metadata and contextual information. This, in turn, enables the system to tailor content delivery based on individual learner preferences, progress, and learning objectives. With eRepo, educators can create dynamic and personalized learning experiences, leading to more effective learning outcomes.

## Features

- **Semantic Annotation**: eRepo allows educators and content creators to add semantic annotations to learning materials. These annotations provide context and meaning to the content.

- **Adaptive Learning**: By leveraging semantic annotations, eRepo enables adaptive learning experiences. Content delivery can be personalized based on learner preferences, progress, and learning goals.

- **LMS Integration**: eRepo is designed to seamlessly integrate with popular Learning Management Systems like Moodle, making it easy to enhance existing educational platforms.

- **Content Management**: The system provides tools for managing and organizing learning content, making it easier for educators to create and deliver courses.

- **Extensible**: The codebase is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of custom features and integrations.
